X's and O's text based game being taught in the Canteen at Coder Dojo Waterford

It is being updated over a number of weeks based on the excellent book by Al Sweigart 'Invent your own games with Python' available at www.inventwithpython.com

The pygame stub is just to allow some of the functions to play the game in the text based game be used in pygame, this is to show the interoperability of computer code.
